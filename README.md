# [Project 1: Data Science Project - Car Price Prediction Using Regression Analysis](https://github.com/dsnic/Car_price_prediction)
* A tool to predict car price depending on some car properties, to understand the factors affecting the prices of cars
* Dimensionality reduction using feature selection techniques (Correlation filter, Random forest and Lasso for feature selection)
* Implementing simple and multiple regression models to find the best model (Linear, Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest)
* Comparing the performance of the models (Coeficient of determination/adjusted coef., p-norm/Lp-norm of vectors)

# [Project 2: Data Science Project - Wine Quality Classification](https://github.com/dsnic/Wine_quality_classification)
* Classification of white wines depending on measured properties
* Feature engineering
* Dimensionality reduction using feature selection (Correlation filter, F-value)
* Simple validation, Cross-validation techniques
* Implementing classification models to find the best model (Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
