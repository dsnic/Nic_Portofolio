# Project 1: Data Science Project - Car Price Prediction Using Regression Analysis
* A tool to predict car price depending on some car properties, to understand the factors affecting the prices of cars
* Dimensionality reduction using feature selection techniques (Correlation filter, Random forest and Lasso for feature selection)
* Implementing simple and multiple regression models to find the best model (Linear, Lasso, Ridge, Random Forest)
* Comparing the performance of the models (Coeficient of determination/adjusted coef., p-norm/Lp-norm of vectors)
